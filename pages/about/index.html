    <h2>Why We Began</h2>
    <p>Emma's Hope, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) charitable nonprofit that we started in honor of our daughter, Emma Grace, who battled a rare form of lung cancer and went home to be with Jesus on February 7th, 2017, just before her second birthday. The fact that she is no longer here with us and that she will never meet her younger brother or play with her older sister again is painful.</p>

    <h2>Why We Are Needed</h2>
    <p>Through Emmaâ€™s Hope, we are able to use what our family went through to directly help other families going through similar circumstances. We know that when your child is going through treatment for a life-threatening illness or cancer, they are your only focus. The treatment plan for a child often demands constant travel and extended hospitals stays. Parents often go weeks and months without working - some even losing their jobs - in order to care for their child.</p>
    <p>At Emma's Hope, we provide financial support to approved families for travel and food expenses as well as unexpected or miscellaneous bills. The heartbreaking loss of a child is enough of a weight on a family in and of itself. Because of that, we help cover bereavement expenses to lighten some of the financial burden for families who have recently lost a child.</p>
